# python-api-challenge

# part I

Created python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator using the OpenWeatherMap API. Created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

- Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
- Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
-  Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

# part II

Created heat map displaying humidity for every city from Part I using Google Places API and then narrowed my dataset to find my ideal weather conditions. Found hotel for each city located withing 5000 meters of my ideal weather coordinates.
